I am a 4th year Systems Neuroscience PhD candidate at Northwestern University, co-advised by Drs. [Netta Gurari](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=37885){:target="\_blank"}
and [Julius Dewald](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=10693){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research focuses on sensorimotor perception and its application in stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, I use methods and techniques from robotics, biomedical engineering, psychology, and neuroscience to study the perception of forces and torques. My interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, AI, and data science.

Prior to that, I studied Biology and Computer Science at Bryn Mawr College. My undergraduate thesis was on the neural control of leech swimming behavior. I also studied abroad in Salvador, Brazil, and conducted a [capstone study](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/2256/){:target="\_blank"} on the effect of physical therapy on the self-esteem of stroke survivors.
